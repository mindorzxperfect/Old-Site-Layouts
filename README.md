The scrubbed old site layouts I've made over the years for picking apart and learning from as both bad examples and occassional inspiration.

These are freely shared to be taken apart, used as inspiration, subject to ridicule, and passed around so long as the license statement remains intact and unchanged. That's literally it. If you'd like to create a fork, you're welcome to do so and fix, modify, and mess with things to your heart's content. These are not meant to be professional by any means and you should expect a lot of messy code.
