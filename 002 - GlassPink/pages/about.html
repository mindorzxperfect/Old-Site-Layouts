            I made this website in an attempt to do something a little more ambitious. It still relies on iframes and most of the free-to-use art has been removed from the overall layout to preserve the original artist's ability to maintain control over it. The CSS is much more organized and utilizes :root color variables.
            <br><br>
            The bridge divider you see above was made by me and is free to use.

<!--//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    This page is more heavily and specifically styled in the <style> tag.
        
    It uses the :root variable from the CSS stylesheet since they're already
    defined and ready to be used, keeping uniformity with the entire
    layout without having to individually change and adjust colors on every
    single subpage.
